Stratigraphic unit
==================

.. toctree::

Stratigraphic units are used to record archaeological data. They are subunits
of a :doc:`feature` which itself is a subunit of a :doc:`place`. For an
archaeological workflow example see :doc:`/examples/archaeological_data`.

Form fields
-----------
* :doc:`/form/name`
* :doc:`type`
* :doc:`/form/date`
* :doc:`/form/description`
* :doc:`/tools/map`

Can be linked via tabs to
-------------------------
* :doc:`source` - when it is referenced there
* :doc:`reference`
* :doc:`artifact`
* :doc:`human_remains`
* :doc:`file`

Anthropological analyses
------------------------

Clicking on the tools button leads you to the
:doc:`/tools/anthropological_analyses`.

Super and subunits
------------------
In the OpenAtlas database a Stratigraphic unit is a subunit of a :doc:`feature`.
A Feature can consist of one or more Stratigraphic units (e.g. grave as feature
can contain one or more burials, a backfilling, etc.). Stratigraphic units
themselves are structured in the same way and can be connected to
:doc:`artifact` and :doc:`human_remains` as their subunits.
